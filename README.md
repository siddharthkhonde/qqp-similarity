1. Incorporated binary classification of the dataset to determine the probabilistic outcome using logarithmic-loss as the performance indicator and binary confusion matrix to determine errors.
2. Performed EDA using statistical methods to understand the data; Implemented basic feature engineering to increase interpretability.
3. Applied text preprocessing to remove HTML tags, punctuations, and stop-words using stemming; Executed advanced feature extraction to split and analyze the question similarity.
4. Visualized 15-D data in 2-D using T-SNE to get more detailed insights; Incorporated NLP techniques to convert words to vectors.
5. Trained the data using Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, and XGBoost to determine the expected outcome efficiently by comparing and minimizing errors.
